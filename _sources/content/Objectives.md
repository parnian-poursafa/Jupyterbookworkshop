## Instructions:
This document provides the instructions for the data preparation and GWAS analyses on the frequency of cannabis use phenotypes in each of the participating cohorts. 
The use of standardized procedures across all samples is critical in order to increase the effectiveness of the meta-analysis. 
Because there is always a chance of error, we may ask some analyses to be re-run. We encourage analysts to organize their scripts, files, and directories just in case a re-analysis is required.
## Aim:
The International Cannabis Consortium has been created to combine the results of multiple genome-wide association studies of different cannabis use phenotypes (e.g., lifetime use, age at initiation, frequency of cannabis use) in meta-analyses in order to increase the probability of detection of genetic variants associated with individual differences in cannabis use. We have published several successful GWAS meta-analyses over the years, including lifetime use and age at initiation. The current document is about the first meta-analysis on the frequency of cannabis use. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

<mark>For this study, only subjects who have used cannabis at least once during their lifetime will be included</mark>

You can follow the procedure in :
1.	Instructions for subject inclusion, phenotypes & covariates 
2.	Instructions for genotypes & imputation
3.	Instructions for association tests
4.	Instructions for file formats and uploading data
